#Import Your Wordpress Posts Into Statamic V2

To use the plugin:

  - Rename the folder Wordpress
  - Copy the renamed folder to /site/addons
  - Add your Wordpress Export to the /resources/data folder and call it wpexport.xml
  - Run php please wordpress:convert

### This is a very early release, and I will be updating it to include importing tags, categories, comments, and pages.
